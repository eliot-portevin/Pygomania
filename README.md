# Pygomania
## The origin of the game
After playing Iron Snout, we (eliot-portevin and MartinWho2) decided to create a similar game to improve our python skills. It ended in a complete different game and now eliot-portevin has given up the project leaving MartinWho2 alone.
## The game
The game is a 1v1 online fight game like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat in a pixel art style composed of 6 different characters. Of course, each character has his own attacks and ultimates...
## The characters
- The Mage 
- The Boxer
- The Dwarf
- The URSS Soldier
- The Gorgone
- The tenniswoman
## Installation of the game 
To install the game, I'll suppose you already have python and git installed. If not, just look at online tutorials to install it.
### Windows
Go into your terminal (cmd) and type 
```
cd {The repository where you want to put the game} 
git clone https://github.com/eliot-portevin/Pygomania
```
### MacOS
You do not diserve to try this game.
## Play
To play, you need at first to launch the program server.py, as my server is not yet installed and the launch the main.py program.
When the game will be finished you'll just have to launch the main.py program and it will be done.
